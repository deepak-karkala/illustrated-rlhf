### Problem → Solution

**Problem**: RLHF resources are either too academic (dense papers) or too
shallow (oversimplified blogs). Practitioners struggle to build intuition for
these critical AI alignment techniques.

**Solution**: Interactive platform combining mathematical rigor with visual
intuition. Learn by doing—adjust parameters, see results, build understanding.
